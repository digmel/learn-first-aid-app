          It's safer to stay inside until an earthquake ends, lay down under the
          table to stay away from falling objects. After that use stairs to exit
          buildings.

          Stay outside and go to an open area away from buildings, power lines,
          trees and streetlights. Lay down and stay on the ground until the
