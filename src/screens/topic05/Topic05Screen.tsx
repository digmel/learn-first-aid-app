          A break or crack in a bone is called a fracture. In the case of an
          open fracture, the broken bone may pierce the skin. But in a closed
          fracture, broken bones may be unstable causing internal bleeding and
          the casualty may develop shock.

          If it is an open fracture, cover the wound with a sterile dressing or
          clean non-fluffy clothes. Apply pressure around a wound and not over
          the protruding bone, to control any bleeding.Then secure the dressing
          with a bandage. After that call for emergency help. Donâ€™t move the
          casualty until the injured part is secured.
