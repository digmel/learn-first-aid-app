          You may need evacuation, be prepared for that. Avoid walking or
          driving through flooded roads and bridges. Remember, after the
          hurricane eye passes, it will return from the opposite direction.

          Be prepared for secondary disasters like flooding, landslides,
          building damage. Make sure that your home is safe, check the walls,
          doors, staircases, and windows for damage. Donâ€™t forget that water may
          have been contaminated.
