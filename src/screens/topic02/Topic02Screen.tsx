          Asthma is a medical condition that affects the airways â€“ tubes that
          carry air in and out of the lungs. If someone has an asthma attack,
          tubes are narrowed, making it difficult to breathe in and out.

          Help them to sit up and lean forward slightly as this may make it
          easier to breathe. Give the inhaler and encourage them to breathe
          slowly and deeply. If the attack becomes severe, or they don't have
          their inhaler, call for emergency.
